# Linked List

A linked list is a linear data structure that consists of a sequence of nodes, where each node contains a value and a reference (or pointer) to the next node in the sequence. The first node in the sequence is called the head of the list.

Linked lists are useful for creating dynamic data structures where the size of the list can change during program execution. Unlike arrays, which have a fixed size, linked lists can grow or shrink as necessary.

There are two main types of linked lists: singly linked lists and doubly linked lists. In a singly linked list, each node only contains a reference to the next node in the sequence. In a doubly linked list, each node contains references to both the next and previous nodes in the sequence.

The process of traversing a linked list involves starting at the head of the list and following the references to each subsequent node until the end of the list is reached. Linked lists are commonly used for implementing other data structures, such as [stacks](../stack), [queues](../queue), and [hash tables](../hashTable).

One potential drawback of linked lists is that they can be less efficient than arrays for certain operations, such as accessing a specific element in the middle of the list. However, they can be more efficient for other operations, such as inserting or deleting elements at arbitrary positions in the list.

Overall, linked lists are a useful and flexible data structure that can be used in a variety of programming contexts.
