# Queue

[Home](https://github.com/Max-im/jsAlgorithms)

In computer science, a queue is a linear data structure that stores elements in a specific order. It follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle, where the first element inserted into the queue is the first one to be removed. New elements are added to the back of the queue, while existing elements are removed from the front.

Queues are often used in computer programs where data must be processed in a specific order, such as a print spooler, message queues in network communication, and task scheduling in operating systems. They can be implemented using an array or a [linked list](../linkedList) data structure, with various operations such as enqueue (add an element to the back of the queue), dequeue (remove an element from the front of the queue), peek (get the element at the front of the queue without removing it), and isFull/isEmpty (check if the queue is full or empty).
