In computer science, a stack is a linear data structure that stores elements in a specific order. It follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle, where the last element inserted into the stack is the first one to be removed. New elements are added to the top of the stack, while existing elements are removed from the top.

Stacks are often used in computer programs where data must be stored and retrieved in a specific order, such as in function calls, expression evaluation, and undo/redo operations. They can be implemented using an array or a [linked list](../linkedList) data structure, with various operations such as push (add an element to the top of the stack), pop (remove the element from the top of the stack), peek (get the element at the top of the stack without removing it), and isEmpty (check if the stack is empty).
